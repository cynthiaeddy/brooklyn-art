# The Brooklyn Museum Art Project
is an app where you can search the museum's vast collection by the artist's name.

## Instructions

Clone this repo.

You'll need to obtain your own API key from the Brooklyn Museum. https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/register

Once you've obtained your api key, you'll need to create a .env file in the root directory with the information API_KEY=your api key here.

There are two directories, server and client. You'll need to do the following on both.

Run npm install and npm start. You will be asked if you would like to run the program on another server. Type "Y" for Yes.

Your browser will automatically launch the app to its home page.

You can shut down both servers by typing Control C in the terminal window where they are running.
