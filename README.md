# The Brooklyn Museum Art Project
is an app where you can search the museum's vast collection by the artist's name.

## Instructions

You'll need to obtain your own API key from the Brooklyn Museum. https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/register
Once you've obtained it, you'll need to create a .env file in the server folder with the information API_KEY=your api key here.

To run this app:

Clone this repo.

There are two directories, server and client. You'll need to do the following on both.

Run npm install and npm start. You will be asked if you would like to run the program on another server. Type "Y" for Yes.

Your browser will automatically launch the app to its home page.

You can shut down the server by typing Control C in the terminal window where it is running.
